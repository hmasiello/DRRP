							<p class="advisory">Collaboration among agencies is necessary for students and youth who are touched by many systems and professionals. When collaboration is directly focused on outcomes for youth, such as integrated paid employment, and the systems that serve them – rather than merely making a hand-off to the next responsible organization – higher rates of employment are more likely. Conversely, without a focus on developing collaborative relationships efforts falter.</p>
							<p class="advisory">Collaboration between schools, vocational rehabilitation (VR), and other partners is effective when there is a clear and compelling rationale for staff to work across agency lines (Fabian, in press). Collaboration is structured around formalized relationships and processes that maximize the expertise and perspectives of students, parents, educators, VR counselors, and other partners involved in the transition process. The relationships and processes should promote individualized student services, supports, and activities and roles, and identify responsibilities of each partner designed and focused on providing the identified needs and supports. The most effective teams work to achieve a direct outcome for youth served, rather than simply coordinate a “hand off” to the next available post-secondary service (Simonsen, Fabian, &amp; Luecking, in press).</p>

							<p class="advisory">It has long been held that collaboration among professionals and service systems is an important component of effective initiatives and services that support the transition of youth with disabilities from school to work and adult life (Wehman, 2013). In fact, without clearly identified roles of, and coordination between, involved parties to this transition, there are potential problems at two levels: 1) individual and 2) partner.</p>
							<ul class="advisory">
								<li>The individual youth level where poor collaboration and poor application of disparate resources may exacerbate an already complicated path to adult employment; and the larger systems.</li>
								<li>The partner level where resources might not be used to maximum effect or, at worst, misapplied, so that the desired outcomes are far less than desired.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="advisory">To put it another way, beneficial outcomes both at the individual youth level and at the larger systems level can best be achieved through the coordinated application of resources and effort. The Center found that interagency collaboration is not a straightforward concept, but that different ways of defining and operationalizing it impacts employment outcomes in transition. For example:</p>
							<ol class="advisory">
								<li>Teams must focus on their purpose and outcomes they want to achieve. Simply convening to meet and chat may contribute to team members’ sociability, but not to outcomes.</li>
								<li>Collaboration is understandably a complex construct, requiring significant additional research to define and develop measures to operationalize it. Lack of adequately acceptable instruments in the field hamper efforts to conduct rigorous research studies.</li>
								<li>Collaboration is just one element of effective transition, and no rigorous studies exist which would assist in determining its specific contribution beyond those of other critical practices, such as work experiences, family involvement, career planning and preparation, among others. However, interagency collaboration can be viewed as the mechanism through which these services and supports are designed, delivered and evaluated.</li>

						<div id="how-to-implement-content" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory">It is optimal for professionals to work collaboratively when they are providing transition-related services to youth with disabilities through an Interagency team. Effective collaboration begins when all stakeholders involved are identified and begin to work on a common goal for the student transitioning to employment. Through thoughtful and committed partners, significant opportunities can be created so the student is able to gain work experience and paid employment prior to their school exit. Effective collaboration focuses on building a system that facilitates an increase in the employment outcomes of transition-age youth.</p>
							<p class="advisory">It is logical for school systems or Vocational Rehabilitation to take on a leadership role in convening the partners. When considering which partners need to be involved, the team should consider identifying critical partners to assist secondary students with career development planning, work experiences, and paid employment.  Potential partners to consider include, but are not limited to: vocational rehabilitation, youth development programs, workforce development, employers, parents and adult service providers that offer job development, placement, and support services. For a list of potential partners and their roles and responsibilities see Tool Section: Partner Roles and Responsibilities.</p>
							<p class="advisory">The entity identified to lead the Interagency team is responsible for convening the partners, establishing the meeting structure, facilitating the meeting, and serving as the primary communicator among all partners. All members of the team should feel a sense of ownership and commitment in order to implement the action plan and achieving the goal of integrated employment. To achieve this intent, the team should:</p>
							<ul class="advisory">
								<li>Establish and reflect a common vision (e.g., paid employment for students with disabilities prior to school exit).</li>
								<li>Agree on goals that are obtainable.</li>
								<li>Institute policy-making procedures that will frame the work of the team (e.g., lines of communication, reporting).</li>
								<li>Hold regular team and work group meetings.</li>
								<li>Develop well-planned agendas.</li>
								<li>Empower all team members to be active and equal participants.</li>
								<li>Promote share decision-making.</li>
								<li>Clarify roles and responsibilities of each team member.</li>

						<div id="roadblocks-content" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory"><strong>Team members may not understand the roles of adult service agencies and how they connect to transition planning for students.</strong><br><em>Suggested Approaches:</em></p>
							<ul class="advisory">
								<li>Develop a flow of services outlining the activities, services, and connections needed to take place each year of high school in order for students to reach their desired employment outcome.</li>
								<li>Outline the roles and responsibilities of each partner.</li>
								<li>Offer cross-training opportunities for partners.</li>
								<li>Use data from various partners to determine activities and services at the system and individual level.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="advisory"><strong>Adult service agencies and schools have difficulty engaging family members in the transition planning process.</strong><br><em>Suggested Approaches:</em></p>
							<ul class="advisory">
								<li>Utilize existing networks and connections (e.g., Parent Education Connection and Parent Training Services) to identify effective parent engagement activities.</li>
								<li>Share the Positive Personal Profile to illustrate student strengths and how those strengths can lead to successful integrated employment after high school.</li>
								<li>Communicate with family members on a regular basis, keep them updated and involved in planning.  Determine from the family the most effective form of communication (e.g., phone, text, e-mail, in-person).</li>
								<li>Invite adult service agency representatives to share information with families during school-based events (e.g., parent-teacher conferences, freshmen orientation, transition fairs, etc.).</li>
								<li>Offer parent trainings as needs are identified.</li>
								<li>Provide written information about adult services to middle school parents so they are aware of the need to connect their youth to services once they begin high school.</li>
								<li>Make the referral process easy for families (e.g., short and easily-understood paperwork; assist family members in completing paperwork).</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="advisory"><strong>Team members indicate they have little time for planning and are susceptible to lost momentum.</strong><br><em>Suggested Approaches:</em></p>
							<ul class="advisory">
								<li>Ensure attendance of key leadership from schools and VR support staff at team meetings.</li>
								<li>Plan a regular meeting time and allow outside agency representatives the option to participate in person, via phone or other technology.</li>
								<li>Designate a leader responsible for coordinating each meeting and developing and distributing an agenda in advance of each meeting.</li>
								<li>Designate a time for the team to review student progress and develop next steps. The conversation should be focused and time limited, generally no longer than one hour per month.</li>
								<li>Develop and distribute an action plan where activities to reach the goal are outlined and team members are assigned to each activity.  Each activity should have a lead person who schedules necessary meetings and ensures work is being completed. When the larger team meets, smaller groups report out on progress and next steps to reach the goal.</li>
								<li>Have a plan of action for integrating new team members. Develop a brochure or one-page document about the collaboration, providing a brief overview to new team members.  Designate mentors to new partners.</li>
								<li>Anticipate team member turnover. When a member leaves, the position may not be filled immediately. Other team members need to plan how to compensate for the absence until a replacement is hired.</li>
