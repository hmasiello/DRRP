							<p class="advisory content">Competitive integrated employment refers to jobs held by people with disabilities in typical workplace settings (not sheltered workshops) where the majority of individuals are not employees with disabilities, where they earn at least minimum wage, and where they are paid directly by the employer. Simply stated, competitive integrated employment is real work for real pay.  To achieve this gold standard of work, families, schools, vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies and other adult service agencies need to actively collaborate in transition planning for the student. One of the key activities in transition planning is for the student to participate in a paid work experience prior to high school graduation. The importance of paid work experience as a significant predicator of post-school employment for youth with disabilities has been well documented (Carter, Austin, &amp; Trainor, 2012; Gold &amp; Fabian, &amp; Luecking, 2013; Test et al., 2009). Services that include real work experiences as a key intervention component are found to have higher rates of youth transitioning into integrated employment (Luecking &amp; Luecking, 2013). These findings are consistent regardless of disability category, where one lives, or their socio-economic status (Gold, Fabian &amp; Luecking, 2013). Therefore, competitive integrated employment is a realistic and desirable expectation for all youth who choose to work, regardless of disability label or need for accommodation and support.</p>
							<p class="advisory content">Evolving federal transition and disability employment policy increasingly reflects the presumption of employability for all individuals with disabilities. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) of 2004, and the recently enacted Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) (2014) are each predicated on the expectation that services delivered through their respective mandates are available to and will benefit all individuals with disabilities to whom the services apply. These policies make employment possible for all categories of youth, regardless of disability, need for support, and economic circumstance.</p>

						<div id="why-is-it-content" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory content">Research has demonstrated that employment is associated with an individual’s overall quality of life or assessment of his/her well-being (Canha, Simoes, Owens, 2013). However, employment outcomes of youth with disabilities consistently lag behind those of their non-disabled peers. A Department of Labor report cited that only 26% of youth with disabilities are employed after high school, compared to almost 64% of their nondisabled peers (2013). Additionally, individuals with disabilities experience the highest rates of poverty of any subcategory of Americans charted by the Census Bureau. Alarmingly, 27 %, or more than 4 million, of the nearly 30 million individuals with disabilities ages 18–64 live in poverty, more than double the rate of the entire population in the same age group (Office of Disability Employments Policy, 2013).</p>

						<div id="how-is-it-content" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory content">To improve employment outcomes for students with disabilities, there should be clear expectations that all students will have a paid work experience in the community while in high school, whether through the school or by other means. Along with work experiences, vocational training is also an important aspect of transition and should be incorporated into transition planning practices (Wehman, et al., 2014). Encouraging the student to participate in vocational training which aligns with his/her career interests, as well as work-based learning experiences, such as job shadowing, work sampling, volunteer work, and service learning will assist the student in becoming more prepared and knowledgeable about the world of work.</p>
							<p class="advisory content">It is equally  important for staff working with transition-age youth to have the resources and flexibility to continuously develop, maintain, and expand a network of employer contacts from which the youth can access for job interviews, job tours, work experiences, and ultimately, paid employment. Employment specialists need to have opportunities to get to know employers and learn about their hiring practices, job requirements, and special employment concerns. To make this feasible, it is important to allow staff responsible for these tasks to flex their time to meet the needs of employers (e.g., weekend and evening hours).</p>

							<p class="advisory content"><strong>Team members are unsure how to approach businesses for work experience opportunities.</strong><br><em>Suggested Approaches:</em></p>
							<ul class="advisory content">
								<li>Provide field-based training in order to establish clear expectations of staff roles and responsibilities.

As part of the training, identify mentors – someone who has the expertise and time to provide some initial support to the trainee.</li>
								<li>Offer field-based assignments, working directly with identified students and employers. Assignments can include completing community-based discovery, assessments, and job development which can lead to summer work experiences and employment.</li>
								<li>Complete informational interviews with businesses to determine their workforce needs.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="advisory content"><strong>Students do not have time in their academic schedule to participate in work experiences or only a select number of students have the opportunity to participate in work experiences.</strong><br><em>Suggested Approaches:</em></p>
							<ul class="advisory content">
								<li>Allow opportunities for school staff to get to know employers and learn about their hiring practices, job requirements, and special employment concerns. Identify a systematic way to prioritize work placement activities for students.</li>
								<li>Provide work experience opportunities outside the school day such as evenings, weekends, winter/spring break and summer.</li>

Additionally, information for the PPP can be gathered from a person centered planning meeting; self-reporting checklists; observation checklists and logs; formal assessment tools (both paper and pencil and hands on types); reports from specialists such as therapists, teachers, and medical personnel; and actual products developed by the job seekers (or photographs, videos, and recordings of these products). Once completed, this tool can be used as an ongoing method of depicting strengths, support needs, and other positive attributes about a youth. Additional uses for the PPP include providing content for resume development, content and language when asked to describe oneself, and the development of goals to be achieved on employment and transition plans as it relates to additional discovery and assessment activities.</li>
