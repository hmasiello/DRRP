							<p class="advisory">Wouldn’t it be ideal if the culmination of secondary education for all students and youth with disabilities was a job and a clear career path? That is, as youth make the transition from being students to young adults the ideal would be that they move  seamlessly from being a student to being an employed young adult and/or to being an enrollee in post-secondary education and training that will lead to a meaningful job and career.  This is indeed the “gold standard” of transition outcomes. The activities of transition and employment initiatives, and the partnerships that support them, are most appropriately judged against this standard.</p>
							<p class="advisory">With what we now know, there is no reason not to expect this to be the desired outcome for every student who receives special education services in today’s high schools. In fact, there is an increasing body of research that suggest that not only can this be the prevailing norm, but we are becoming increasingly aware of what makes this possible for every student and youth, regardless of the disability label, the nature of the disability, and the need for support and accommodation.</p>
							<p class="advisory">What really works so that students with disabilities seamlessly transition to adult employment? What does research say? How can what research says be translated into everyday practice? In other words, how can we take what we know to have the most influence on successful adult employment for youth with disabilities and apply it to education and transition service to these youth? How can we organize education and transition service for those youth who will need support to find and keep jobs, and who will need various levels of support during their employment careers? Good questions, all!</p>
							<p class="advisory">This Toolkit intends to address these questions.  It is designed to help people in the field – teachers, transition professionals, rehabilitation counselors, adult employment service professionals, families and youth – make this happen, particularly for those youth who will need the most support during their transition and beyond. The contents are derived from research conducted by the Center for Transition to Employment for Youth with Disabilities (the Center), other related research, and extensive experience in the field by the authors in applying this research. As we examine this research we can see a clearer picture of what it takes to promote successful and seamless transition to employment.</p>

						<h2><a tabIndex="0" class="toggle" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="what-is-seamless">What is Seamless Transition?</a></h2>
						<div id="what-is-seamless" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory">The concept of seamless transition for this Toolkit borrows from the Transition Services Integration Model (TSIM) originally implemented by Certo, Luecking, et al. (2009) which endeavors to integrate services at the point of transition so that the first day after school exit looks no different than the last day of school. That is, students exit school already in a job, with supports in place to keep this job and to pursue new jobs and career advancement throughout their adult life.  Thus, we refer to the move from school to employment and adult life as “seamless” because there is no interruption of service and support after school exit to maintain employment.</p>
							<p class="advisory">While TSIM addresses services integrated during the final year in school, the research of the Center had identified additional elements that begin much earlier in high school and that include important components that contribute to successful seamless transition. It also broadens the concept of “seamless-ness” to include the uninterrupted movement from secondary school to other activities designed to lead to post-secondary jobs and careers, including post-secondary education, occupational training, and linkages to services designed to facilitate adult employment.</p>
							<p class="advisory">For the purposes of this Tookit, then, seamless transition is both a process and an outcome. It is defined as:</p>
							<p class="advisory"><em>A sequential delivery of specific preparatory and coordinated services that begin in early high school and continue through post-school follow-up supports, with the intended outcome of each student employed in an individualized, integrated job of choice and/or enrolled in postsecondary education prior to school exit.</em></p>
							<p class="advisory">No one involved in facilitating student and youth transition should be in a position to figure it out how to make this happen on their own. Nor should they be in a position to make it up as they go along. Fortunately, there is a growing volume of research to show the way.</p>

						<div id="what-makes-successful" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory">Here's what contemporary research says:</p>
							<ul class="advisory">
								<li>Employment is possible for all categories of youth, regardless of disability, need for support, and economic circumstances of their communities (Sima, et al., 2014; Gold, Fabian &amp; Luecking, 2014; Dong, Fabian &amp; Luecking, 2015; Carter, Trainor &amp; Austin, 2012).</li>
								<li>Adult employment is more likely when students have work experiences and jobs during their secondary school years and when their families expect and support employment (Sima, et al; Fraker, et al, in review; Carter, et al, Fabian, 2007).</li>
								<li>There are some factors that put students at risk for poor post-school employment success, but the impact of these factors can be minimized by specific circumstances and interventions (Sima, et al).</li>
								<li>Collaboration among professionals and programs is often necessary for students and youth who are touched by many systems and professionals (Luecking &amp; Luecking, 2015; Getzel, et al., 2015; Wehman, 2014).</li>
								<li>When collaboration is directly focused on outcomes for youth and the systems that serve them – rather than merely referring them for a “hand off” to the next responsible party – higher school completion and employment rates are likely (Luecking &amp; Luecking, 2015; Fabian &amp; Luecking, 2014). Conversely, without a focus on work and work experience, collaboration efforts falter (Getzel, et al., 2015).</li>
								<li>Employers will provide work experiences and jobs to youth with disabilities under specific circumstances of transition professional/program competence and the identification of youth traits that match employer needs (Simonsen, Fabian &amp; Luecking, 2015).</li>
								<li>There are traits in transition professionals that can be identified and encouraged that will make these professionals especially effective in facilitating competitive integrated employment (Tilson &amp; Simonsen, 2012).</li>

						<h2 class="advisory"><a tabIndex="0" class="toggle" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="work-is-the-reason">Work is the reason!</a></h2>
						<div id="work-is-the-reason" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory">Work experience in high school is the most important factor in predicting adult employment. For example, Sima, et al. (2014) examined the data from the National Longitudinal Study 2. They found that those youth who were employed for pay in high school were universally more likely to be employed at the later point than those who were not employed, with the percentage of employment ranging from 61.6% to 88.5%. Additionally, family expectations of work contributed to increased prospects of post school employment. Moreover, they found that even youth considered “at risk” of poor employment outcomes are likely to achieve employment under circumstances of exposure to work in high school (Sima, West, et al, 2014).</p>
							<p class="advisory">Similarly, Gold, Fabian &amp; Luecking (2014) found that in a national youth employment program operated by the Marriott Foundation for People with Disabilities (MFPD) over 80% of participating youth with a range of disabilities achieved successful employment. MFPD’s program, called <em>Bridges… from school to work</em>, or simply <em>Bridges</em>, achieved these results in programs operated in primarily urban areas serving predominantly minority youth. In addition, these outcomes were consistent regardless of the economic effect of the recent Great Recession in the respective cities where <em>Bridges</em> operates.</p>
							<p class="advisory">In another study of <em>Bridges</em>, Dong, Fabian &amp; Luecking found that student job placement rates were primarily attributed to student characteristics and job match efforts, rather than the quality of schools they attend. In other words, regardless of where students attended school, what kinds of educational services they received at those schools, and what kinds of neighborhoods in which those schools were located, the presence of a concerted effort to create job opportunities resulted in positive employment outcomes.</p>
							<p class="advisory">One more striking example of the value of work experiences and work was provided by one study of the National Youth Transition Demonstration (YTD) (Fraker, 2014). YTD intended to focus on youth receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI eligibility requires youth to have a significant disability and low family income. The dual influences of disability and poverty have contributed to these youth as a group to experience among the most intractably low employment rates among transitioning youth. In a study of youth in the Miami, Florida, YTD program, Fraker, et al., found that of the over 800 youth who participated, youth who experienced paid work as part of their transition intervention had a significantly higher rate of employment and earned more income three years later than those youth who did not participate in the intervention. In other words, the impact of both poverty and disability can be minimized when transition programs offer work opportunities.</p>
							<p class="advisory">Finally, it is important to mention that many other researchers have identified work experience and work in high school as predictors of successful adult employment (Carter, et al., 2010) This was the case over 15 year ago (Luecking &emp; Fabian, 2001) and over 30 years ago (Hazasi, et al. , 1985). It is still the case. Evolving research and practice are now revealing how to make this the norm rather than the exception.</p>

						<h2 class="advisory"><a tabIndex="0" class="toggle" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collaboration">Collaboration is necessary for many youth</a></h2>
						<div id="collaboration" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory">Students and youth with disabilities will be touched by multiple systems, entities and professionals at various times during their movement through secondary education and beyond. For this reason, collaboration and interagency partnerships have long been promoted as essential components of effective transition practice. In fact, there is recent research that suggests that not only is collaboration important, but under the right conditions it can lead to desired outcomes for youth with disabilities in transition from school to careers and adult life.</p>
							<p class="advisory">This means that various combinations of service components will have to work together on behalf of commonly served youth, with the common goal of adult employment for these youth. These entities can include schools, vocational rehabilitation agencies, intellectual and developmental disabilities agencies, mental health agencies, workforce programs, adult employment programs, public benefits management programs, and other social service programs. For example, one model of seamless transition service collaboration was implemented and studied in 11 school districts in Maryland (Luecking &amp; Luecking, 2015). Through local collaborations and between educators, vocational rehabilitation counselors, adult employment service providers, and other partners, youth eligible for vocational rehabilitation services participated in a sequential series of services that resulted in seamless transition to employment and/or enrollment in postsecondary education or training. One way of depicting the flow of transition services and the accompanying collaboration is adapted from the Maryland demonstration and depicted in Figure 1.</p>
							<p class="advisory">The Workforce Innovation Opportunities Act (WIOA), passed by Congress in 2014, stipulates that vocational rehabilitation agencies should work with schools so that work experiences occur well before projected school exit. WIOA reinforces what research has demonstrated – work experience in high school is important for career development, AND collaboration between schools, vocational rehabilitation and other partners is likely to make adult employment successful. For example, one study (Fabian &amp; Luecking, 2015) examined transition teams comprised of members who scored high on a scale measuring empowerment, trust and team synergy. These teams did not yield employment outcomes for youth as high as teams comprised of members who scored high on task-oriented perceptions of collaboration. In other words, when collaboration is directly focused on work outcomes for youth– rather than merely feeling good about working together or simply referring youth for a “hand off” to the next responsible party – higher adult employment rates are likely.  Without the resources and resolve by transition partners to make this happen, inconsistently implemented interventions and low employment outcomes are likely (Getzel, et al., 2015).</p>

						<div id="it-does-not-happen" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory">Work experiences and jobs for youth only happen when employers are willing to offer these opportunities to them. Therefore, one of the most important skills of transition professionals is the ability to engage employers in this endeavor. How do employers regard youth with disabilities and those transition professionals who support these youth in their pursuit of work experiences? What do employers expect when they agree to host youth for work experiences or to hire them for jobs in their companies? What traits characterize those transition professionals who are most successful at helping youth get and keep jobs? Contemporary research points to key important factors that help answer these questions.</p>
							<p class="advisory">First, in a recent study conducted by the Center, researchers explored factors contributing to employer decisions to hire youth with disabilities who were participating in the national multi-site transition program called the Bridges… from school to work program (Bridges) administered by the Marriott Foundation for People with Disabilities (Simonsen, Fabian &amp; Luecking, 2015). One hundred (100) employers of Bridges participants responded to a survey designed to measure information about the company, the employer’s perceptions of the hiring process and the role of the employment specialist.</p>
							<p class="advisory">The respondents indicated that the youths’ “ability to perform the job” was the most important reason for hiring them. Interestingly, only a small percentage (3%) of respondents indicated that the most important reason for hiring the Bridges youth was to fill a current position. Overall confidence in the employment specialist was important regardless of company size. The reputation of the agency (in this case, Bridges) was also an important factor in the hiring decision. Clearly, establishing a strong relationship with the employment specialist and the employment agency is highly valued by this sample.</p>
							<p class="advisory">The study also assessed additional factors that might contribute to the hiring decision, such as the companies’ commitment to diversity, their desire to ‘give back to the community, or their perspective on expanding employment opportunities for all people with disabilities. While some of these factors were endorsed, particularly by smaller companies, they were considerably less important in the hiring decision than the reputation of the employment agency and the relationship established with the employment specialist.</p>
							<p class="advisory">Overall, this study and others (e.g., Domzal, Houtenville &amp; Sharma, 2008; Ju, Roberts &amp; Zhang, 2013; Simonsen, Fabian and Luecking, 2011) suggest the following for transition professionals as they seek to effectively engage employers:</p>
								<ul class="advisory">
									<li>Market the competent service of the professional or school/organization representing the youth.</li>
									<li>Spend time visiting companies to learn how they operate and what they need.</li>
									<li>Be prepared to identify specific benefits to the company offered by individual youth.</li>
									<li>Look for opportunities to negotiate work tasks that are “customized” to individual youth and that meet a specific company need.</li>
									<li>Avoid marketing appeals based on disability. Those that “sell disability” as a way of recruiting employers will not likely influence employer hiring behavior. In fact, promoting disability awareness is likely useful only in the context of other factors previously mentioned.</li>
									<li>Transition professionals should be prepared to show how a youth job seeker will add value to the business’ bottom line, rather than how well the youth might fill an existing position.</li>
								</ul>
							<p class="advisory">These findings also discredit the notion of using want ads and job opening postings as the primary or most effective ways to develop employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Rather, direct job developer contact and interaction with employers to learn of business operational needs are far more useful strategies. These strategies will be detailed in later sections of this Toolkit.</p>

						<div id="skilled-transition" aria-hidden="true">
							<p class="advisory">Students and youth, particularly those who require unusual or extensive support, benefit from assistance from various transition professionals. As they prepare and plan for work experiences and jobs, their success will be largely dependent on the skill and competence of these professionals – professionals who know how to identify students’ best trait  and know how to introduce them to prospective employers. What does it take for these professionals to do this well? What attributes and skills do they need? Again, research points to some answers.</p>
							<p class="advisory">The Center conducted intensive telephone surveys with employment specialists from the MFPD Bridges program. The professionals who were interviewed worked with youth with a variety of disabilities (including intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, autism, and emotional disabilities) primarily in urban settings. This program has been in existence since 1989 and has enrolled more than 20,000 youth with disabilities in eight cities over its history to date, with overall job placement and retention rates that exceed 80% in almost all of its locations. It is obvious that the Bridges professionals know what they are doing.</p>
							<p class="advisory">The surveys revealed four distinct personal attributes of these highly effective professionals:</p>
							<ol class="advisory">
								<li><strong>Principled optimism</strong>, a belief that all youth, regardless of disability, can become contributing members of the work force, that is, they presume all youth can work.</li>
								<li><strong>Cultural competence</strong>, adeptness at working with culturally and linguistically diverse youth, that is, they respect each youth’s background and circumstances and help youth use it to their advantage.</li>
								<li><strong>Business-oriented professionalism</strong>, a work ethic that helps them see their work through a “business lens,” that is, they work to understand what employers need.</li>
								<li><strong>Networking savvy</strong>, skill at connecting with people and resources, that is, they know how to “get around” in their communities.</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="advisory">What this tells us is that, above all, there are two very important ingredients for successful employment outcomes for youth with disabilities: the presumption of employability and meeting employer operational needs. The first requires the belief in the inherent value of all people with disabilities as potentially contributing workers, regardless of the nature of the disability or the need for supports. The second requires the recognition that effective transition to employment service delivery is predicated on an understanding of how employers operate and what they need. This Toolkit is predicated on these principles, along with the value of collaboration to make this happen.</p>

								<li>Collaborate around the common outcome of integrated paid employment. Effective teams work together to achieve direct outcomes for youth served, rather than simply making a “hand off” to the next available agency or service.</li>

Ideal and effective teams are characterized by a mutually supportive relationships and a commitment from all partners to support student achieve employment goals. Clarifying roles and responsibilities of the various team members is key to this process. In doing so, teams consider the benefit each member would contribute by being part of the team.</li>
