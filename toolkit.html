						<h2>Introduction<span class="expand"><a href="#"> +</a></span>  <span class="collapse"><a href="#"> &ndash;</a></span></h2>
						<p class="advisory content">Wouldn’t it be ideal if the culmination of secondary education for all students and youth with disabilities was a job and a clear career path? That is, as youth make the transition from being students to young adults the ideal would be that they move  seamlessly from being a student to being an employed young adult and/or to being an enrollee in post-secondary education and training that will lead to a meaningful job and career.  This is indeed the “gold standard” of transition outcomes. The activities of transition and employment initiatives, and the partnerships that support them, are most appropriately judged against this standard.</p>
						<p class="advisory content">With what we now know, there is no reason not to expect this to be the desired outcome for every student who receives special education services in today’s high schools. In fact, there is an increasing body of research that suggest that not only can this be the prevailing norm, but we are becoming increasingly aware of what makes this possible for every student and youth, regardless of the disability label, the nature of the disability, and the need for support and accommodation.</p>
						<p class="advisory content">What really works so that students with disabilities seamlessly transition to adult employment? What does research say? How can what research says be translated into everyday practice? In other words, how can we take what we know to have the most influence on successful adult employment for youth with disabilities and apply it to education and transition service to these youth? How can we organize education and transition service for those youth who will need support to find and keep jobs, and who will need various levels of support during their employment careers? Good questions, all!</p>
						<p class="advisory content">This Toolkit intends to address these questions.  It is designed to help people in the field – teachers, transition professionals, rehabilitation counselors, adult employment service professionals, families and youth – make this happen, particularly for those youth who will need the most support during their transition and beyond. The contents are derived from research conducted by the Center for Transition to Employment for Youth with Disabilities (the Center), other related research, and extensive experience in the field by the authors in applying this research. As we examine this research we can see a clearer picture of what it takes to promote successful and seamless transition to employment.

						<h2>What is Seamless Transition?<span class="expand"><a href="#"> +</a></span>  <span class="collapse"><a href="#"> &ndash;</a></span></h2></h2>
						<p class="advisory content">The concept of seamless transition for this Toolkit borrows from the Transition Services Integration Model (TSIM) originally implemented by Certo, Luecking, et al. (2009) which endeavors to integrate services at the point of transition so that the first day after school exit looks no different than the last day of school. That is, students exit school already in a job, with supports in place to keep this job and to pursue new jobs and career advancement throughout their adult life.  Thus, we refer to the move from school to employment and adult life as “seamless” because there is no interruption of service and support after school exit to maintain employment.</p>
						<p class="advisory content">While TSIM addresses services integrated during the final year in school, the research of the Center had identified additional elements that begin much earlier in high school and that include important components that contribute to successful seamless transition. It also broadens the concept of “seamless-ness” to include the uninterrupted movement from secondary school to other activities designed to lead to post-secondary jobs and careers, including post-secondary education, occupational training, and linkages to services designed to facilitate adult employment.</p>
						<p class="advisory content">For the purposes of this Tookit, then, seamless transition is both a process and an outcome. It is defined as:</p>
						<p class="advisory content"><em>A sequential delivery of specific preparatory and coordinated services that begin in early high school and continue through post-school follow-up supports, with the intended outcome of each student employed in an individualized, integrated job of choice and/or enrolled in postsecondary education prior to school exit.</em></p>
						<p class="advisory content">No one involved in facilitating student and youth transition should be in a position to figure it out how to make this happen on their own. Nor should they be in a position to make it up as they go along. Fortunately, there is a growing volume of research to show the way.</p>

						<p class="advisory content">Here's what contemporary research says:</p>
						<ul class="advisory content">
							<li>Establish and reflect a common vision (e.g., paid employment for students with disabilities prior to school exit).</li>
							<li>Agree on goals that are obtainable.</li>
							<li>Institute policy-making procedures that will frame the work of the team (e.g., lines of communication, reporting).</li>
							<li>Hold regular team and work group meetings.</li>
							<li>Develop well-planned agendas.</li>
							<li>Empower all team members to be active and equal participants.</li>
							<li>Promote share decision-making.</li>
							<li>Clarify roles and responsibilities of each team member.</li>

						<p class="advisory content"><strong>System level:</strong></p>
						<ul class="advisory content">
							<li>Define the team purpose – common goal is integrated employment for the student.</li>
							<li>Actively engage family members in the transition process.</li>
							<li>Make family resources user-friendly and limit use of system/agency jargon.</li>
							<li>Work jointly with parent networks on parent engagement strategies and connections.</li>
							<li>Form relationships and connections with postsecondary education entities to facilitate a more seamless transition for youth pursing further education and training.</li>
							<li>Encourage, integrate, and value contributions from all team members during the students’ transition plan development and implementation.</li>
							<li>Ensure team members understand the roles of each partner and how each contributes to the overall transition plan for the student.</li>
							<li>Meet regularly to discuss progress and updates to individual students’ transition plans to maximize communication, resources, and expertise of all partners.</li>
							<li>Establish mechanism for ongoing communication among all partners.</li>

						<h2>Potential roadblocks/suggested approaches<span class="expand"><a href="#"> +</a></span>  <span class="collapse"><a href="#"> &ndash;</a></span></h2></h2>
						<p class="advisory content"><strong>Team members may not understand the roles of adult service agencies and how they connect to transition planning for students.</strong><br><em>Suggested Approaches:</em></p>
						<ul class="advisory content">
							<li>Develop a flow of services outlining the activities, services, and connections needed to take place each year of high school in order for students to reach their desired employment outcome.</li>
							<li>Outline the roles and responsibilities of each partner.</li>
							<li>Offer cross-training opportunities for partners.</li>
							<li>Use data from various partners to determine activities and services at the system and individual level.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="advisory content"><strong>Adult service agencies and schools have difficulty engaging family members in the transition planning process.</strong><br><em>Suggested Approaches:</em></p>
						<ul class="advisory content">
							<li>Utilize existing networks and connections (e.g., Parent Education Connection and Parent Training Services) to identify effective parent engagement activities.</li>
							<li>Share the Positive Personal Profile to illustrate student strengths and how those strengths can lead to successful integrated employment after high school.</li>
							<li>Communicate with family members on a regular basis, keep them updated and involved in planning.  Determine from the family the most effective form of communication (e.g., phone, text, e-mail, in-person).</li>
							<li>Invite adult service agency representatives to share information with families during school-based events (e.g., parent-teacher conferences, freshmen orientation, transition fairs, etc.).</li>
							<li>Offer parent trainings as needs are identified.</li>
							<li>Provide written information about adult services to middle school parents so they are aware of the need to connect their youth to services once they begin high school.</li>
							<li>Make the referral process easy for families (e.g., short and easily-understood paperwork; assist family members in completing paperwork).</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="advisory content"><strong>Team members indicate they have little time for planning and are susceptible to lost momentum.</strong><br><em>Suggested Approaches:</em></p>
						<ul class="advisory content">
							<li>Ensure attendance of key leadership from schools and VR support staff at team meetings.</li>
							<li>Plan a regular meeting time and allow outside agency representatives the option to participate in person, via phone or other technology.</li>
							<li>Designate a leader responsible for coordinating each meeting and developing and distributing an agenda in advance of each meeting.</li>
							<li>Designate a time for the team to review student progress and develop next steps. The conversation should be focused and time limited, generally no longer than one hour per month.</li>
							<li>Develop and distribute an action plan where activities to reach the goal are outlined and team members are assigned to each activity.  Each activity should have a lead person who schedules necessary meetings and ensures work is being completed. When the larger team meets, smaller groups report out on progress and next steps to reach the goal.</li>
							<li>Have a plan of action for integrating new team members. Develop a brochure or one-page document about the collaboration, providing a brief overview to new team members.  Designate mentors to new partners.</li>
							<li>Anticipate team member turnover. When a member leaves, the position may not be filled immediately. Other team members need to plan how to compensate for the absence until a replacement is hired.</li>

						<ul class="advisory content">
							<li>Collaborate around the common outcome of integrated paid employment. Effective teams work together to achieve direct outcomes for youth served, rather than simply making a “hand off” to the next available agency or service.</li>
							<li>Define roles and responsibilities.  Ideal and effective teams are characterized by a mutually supportive relationships and a commitment from all partners to support student achieve employment goals. Clarifying roles and responsibilities of the various team members is key to this process. In doing so, teams consider the benefit each member would contribute by being part of the team.</li>
